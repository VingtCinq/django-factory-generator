django-factory-generator
========================

Generate (factory_boy) Model Factory for each model of your Django app

Changelog
=========

-  1.0.0 Init project

Requirements
------------

This Django app generates factory_boy Model Factories from your
installed apps, so you need to have
`factory_boy <https://github.com/FactoryBoy/factory_boy>`__ installed.

Installation
------------

Install using ``pip`` :

``pip install django_factory_generator``

Add ``factory_generator`` to your ``INSTALLED_APPS`` settings.

.. code:: python

    INSTALLED_APPS = (
        ...
        'factory_generator',
        ...
    )

Generate factories
------------------

Generate factories with a single command line:

``python manage.py generate_factories``

This will create a ``model_factories`` directory with the following
structure :

::

    |__ model_factories/
        |__ app_label_foo/
            |__ __init__.py
            |__ model_foo.py
            |__ model_bar.py
            |__ base/
                |__ __init__.py
                |__ model_foo.py
                |__ model_bar.py

Each model results in two generated files :

-  *model_factories/app_label_foo/base/model_foo* containing the
   ``ModelFooFactoryBase`` class definition generated from the model
   ``ModelFoo``. This file **should not be manually edited** since it
   would be overriden each time the command ``generate_factories`` is
   run.
-  *model_factories/app_label_foo/model_foo* containing the
   ``ModelFooFactory`` class which simply extends
   ``ModelFooFactoryBase``. This file is generated once but not
   overriden when you run the ``generate_factories`` command again.

This structure gives you the ability to **override** the ModelFactory
that was automatically generated. You can then edit the
``ModelFooFactory`` to change / edit the base fields that were
generated.

You can then import your model factories the following way:

::

    # app_label/tests.py
    from django.test import TestCase

    from model_factories.app_label import ModelFooFactory, ModelBarFactory

    class FooTests(TestCase):

        def test_model_factory(self):
            modelfoo = ModelFooFactory(
                foo='bar',
            )
            modelbar = ModelBarFactory(
                bar='baz',
            )
            # Run your tests here

Settings
--------

Here are all the settings you can use, with their default value :

::

    FACTORY_NORMALIZE_FIELD_MAP = {}
    FACTORY_FIELD_FAKER_MAP = {}
    FACTORY_IGNORE_FIELDS = []
    FACTORY_ROOT_DIR = 'model_factories'
    FACTORY_IGNORE_NON_EDITABLE_FIELDS = True

Todo
----

-  Improve documentation
-  Write unit tests
-  validate compatibility with previous versions of Django and Python
